Introduction - The board game market is all the rage and many young people like to socialise through board games, so we researched the game content of some of the board games on the market and designed 'Explorers' Travel' using AR as a presentation.

For more information about the game and how to play it, please check out the pdf file and video link in Github. We uploaded the file to Dropbox because the source file is too large (the file is too large for online preview, but it can be downloaded)
